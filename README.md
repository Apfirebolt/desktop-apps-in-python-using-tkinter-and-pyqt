# A collection of small desktop based apps in Python

Desktop apps such as calculator, clock and others in Python using Tkinter, PyQT5 and Pyside2.

## Getting Started

Create a new virtual environment as a best practice norm. Install python packages through pip using the bundled requirements
file. Tkinter already comes bundled with Python, but you'd need to install other similar alternatives used in this repository like PySide2 and PyQT5.
